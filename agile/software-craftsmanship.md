# Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship

As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar <br/>
of professional software development by practicing it and helping <br/>
others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

Not only working software,<br/>
but also **well-crafted software**

Not only responding to change,<br/>
but also **steadily adding value**

Not only individuals and interactions,<br/>
but also **a community of professionals**

Not only customer collaboration,<br/>
but also **productive partnerships**

That is, pursuit of the items on the left we have found the<br/>
items on the right to be indispensable.
